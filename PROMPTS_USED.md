# Prompts Used for Frontend Development


## Hero Section
> "Build a high-end Hero section for 'Task Gen'. Use Svelte 5. pure black theme with deep blue and indigo gradients. Focus on typography—use 'Inter' or 'Outfit', large tracking-tight headers, and glassmorphism buttons with 50% blur."

## Streaming Loaders
> "Create a 'Spec Architecting' state. Instead of a spinner, use a glowing blue 'Loader2' icon with a pulsing background blur. Add text explaining that the AI is architecting user stories and engineering plans."

## Tasks Column
> "Refactor the task list into a 3-column Kanban board (Frontend, Backend, Testing). Each column needs its own icon (Layout, Server, TestTube) and a counter. Tasks should be cards. Keep it minimal: dark gray borders, no backgrounds unless hovered."

## AI Retries
> "Build an 'API Overloaded' state for spec generation. Add a live countdown timer showing the next retry attempt (e.g., 'Retrying in 4:59'). Use an amber-colored 'Clock' icon and mono font for the timer to show the system is waiting for a window."

## Status Dashboard
> "Create a Status page layout. Each service (Database, AI Service) should be a card with a status indicator (Connected/Disconnected). Use Svelte's {#await} blocks to stream these checks so each card updates independently as the server responds."

## Auth-Aware Layout
> "Generate a sticky header that hides/shows navigation based on session state. If logged in, show user avatar, name, and a sign out button with 'LogOut' icon. The header needs a heavy backdrop-blur effect (32px) to float over content."

## Spec History
> "Design a 'History' card layout. Feature goal as the main title and template type as a colored tag (e.g. 'E-commerce' in blue, 'SaaS' in purple). Add a relative time display (e.g. '2 hours ago') and a delete icon on hover."
